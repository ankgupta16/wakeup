Wake Up! is an Android application that allows you to maximize your sleep time
by allowing you to sleep peacefully and safely when you're on a bus. It allows
you to set an alarm which is triggered when you approach your destination. This
way you set an alarm when you get on, go to sleep, and get woken up right on 
time. 

I wrote this app mostly for my own benefit, but plan on releasing it to the 
Android Market in the near future as a free application. If you have any 
thoughts, comments, feedback, please let me know via email.

LICENSING:

CONTRIBUTING:
If you want to contribute to WakeUp! in any way, I'd be thrilled. Get in touch
with me before you get started on anything though. Couple of things about this.
I've tried to follow my own coding standards, which I haven't formally
defined anywhere. I ask that you conform to my standards to the extent possible.
Here are a couple of things I would really like some help on: 
1. Icons. I'm hopeless at creating icons. 
2. UI Design. I don't have any formal training in UI design. If you have
suggestions or fixes, I'd love to hear about them.
3. I'm pretty new to Android, and have never really had my own full fledged
project. So if you think I'm doing something wrong, please let me know.
