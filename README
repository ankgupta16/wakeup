Wake Up! is an Android application that allows you to maximize your sleep time
by allowing you to sleep peacefully and safely when you're on a bus. It allows
you to set an alarm which is triggered when you approach your destination. This
way you set an alarm when you get on, go to sleep, and get woken up right on 
time. 

I wrote this app mostly for my own benefit, but plan on releasing it to the 
Android Market in the near future as a free application. If you have any 
thoughts, comments, feedback, please let me know via email.
